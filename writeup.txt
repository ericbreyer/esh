TESTING STRATEGY

Test 1: Empty strings in the search path
Make sure that an empty search path, a path with colons at the begining or end, 
or a path with two consecutive colons will treat these empty strings as "./"
(the current directory). This tests the part of our code that does that.

Test 2: Empty command line argument
Make sure the shell doesn't segfault on an empty argument. Tests the 
eval/builtin functions for this.

Test 3: Invalid command/file
make it print "<argv[0]>: Command not found." if it cant find an executable or
valid builtin. Tests the part of eval that checks for this.

Test 4: Invalid pid/jid input to bg/fg
Make sure these builtins print the right output on invalid inputs.

Test 5: non numeric pid/jid to bg/fg
Make sure these builtins print the right output on invalid inputs.
